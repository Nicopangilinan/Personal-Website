								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title">Tokyo Ghoul (Tōkyō Gūru)</h2>
								<p class="mb-4">Is a Japanese dark fantasy manga series written and illustrated by Sui Ishida. It was serialized in Shueisha's seinen manga magazine Weekly Young Jump between September 2011 and September 2014, and was collected in fourteen tankōbon volumes. A prequel, titled Tokyo Ghoul [Jack], ran online on Jump Live in 2013 and was collected in a single tankōbon volume. A sequel, titled Tokyo Ghoul:re, was serialized in Weekly Young Jump between October 2014 and July 2018, and was collected in sixteen tankōbon volumes.</p>
								<p class="mb-4">A 12-episode anime television series adaptation by studio Pierrot aired on Tokyo MX between July and September 2014. A 12-episode second season, Tokyo Ghoul √A (pronounced Tokyo Ghoul Root A), which follows an original story, aired from January to March 2015. A live-action film based on the manga was released in Japan in July 2017. An anime adaptation based on the sequel manga, Tokyo Ghoul:re, aired for two seasons; the first from April to June 2018, and the second from October to December 2018.</p>
								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title">Setting</h2>
								<p class="mb-4">The story follows Ken Kaneki, a student who barely survives a deadly encounter with Rize Kamishiro, his date who reveals herself as a ghoul. He is taken to the hospital in critical condition. After recovering, Kaneki discovers that he underwent a surgery that transformed him into a half-ghoul. This was accomplished because some of Rize's organs were transferred into his body, and now, like normal ghouls, he must consume human flesh to survive. The ghouls who manage the coffee shop "Anteiku" (あんていく) take him in and teach him to deal with his new life as a half-ghoul. Some of his daily struggles include fitting into the ghoul society, as well as keeping his identity hidden from his human companions, especially from his best friend, Hideyoshi Nagachika.</p>
								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title">Anime</h2>	
								<p class="mb-4">In November 2019, Crunchyroll listed Black Clover in their "Top 100 best anime of the 2010s". In December 2020, Crunchyroll announced the aggregated Top 10 most popular anime works by country and region during the period from July to September of the same year, and it was revealed that Black Clover was the most watched anime, ranking in a total of 19 countries including the United States, Australia, Brazil and France.</p>
