								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title">Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin)</h2>
								<p class="mb-4">An anime television series adapting the manga was produced by Wit Studio (seasons 1–3) and MAPPA (season 4). A 25-episode first season was broadcast from April to September 2013, followed by a 12-episode second season broadcast from April to June 2017. A 22-episode third season was broadcast in two parts, with the first 12 episodes airing from July to October 2018 and the last 10 episodes airing from April to July 2019. A fourth and final season premiered in December 2020.</p>
								<p class="mb-4">Attack on Titan has become a critical and commercial success. As of December 2019, the manga has over 100 million tankōbon copies in print worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. It has won several awards, including the Kodansha Manga Award, the Micheluzzi Award, and Harvey Award. The anime series has also been well received by critics, with the first three seasons being met with praise for their story, animation, music and voice acting, thus boosting the series' popularity in the U.S. and Asia. Although it has gained significant fame and popularity in Japan's neighbouring countries, political interpretations of the series have caused controversies in China and South Korea.</p>
								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title">Setting</h2>
								<p class="mb-4">The plot mostly takes place within three walls, said to be the last location where humans still live, as the rest of the world has been taken over by human-eating Titans. As the story progresses, the setting slowly evolves beyond the walls, revealing secrets of the outside world.</p>
								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title">Plot</h2>	
								<p class="mb-4">The central protagonist is a boy named Eren Yeager (or Jaeger) who lives in the town of Shiganshina, located on the edge of Wall Maria, the outermost of three circular walls protecting humanity from Titans said to have killed all other humans one hundred years prior to the start of the story. In the year 845, the wall is breached by two new types of Titan, named the Colossal (alternatively named the Colossus) and the Armored, and Eren's mother is eaten by a Titan while Eren escapes. He swears revenge on all Titans and enlists in the military along with his childhood friends, Mikasa Ackermann and Armin Arlert.</p>
