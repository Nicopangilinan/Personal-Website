								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title">Black Clover (Burakku Kurōbā)</h2>
								<p class="mb-4"> is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yūki Tabata. The story centers around Asta, a young boy seemingly born without any magic power, something that is unknown in the world he lives in. With his fellow mages from the Black Bulls, Asta plans to become the next Wizard King. It has been serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine since February 2015, and has been collected into 26 tankōbon volumes as of October 2020.</p>
								<p class="mb-4">The manga was first adapted into an original video animation produced by Xebec Zwei, released in 2017. An anime television series adaptation produced by Pierrot premiered in Japan on TV Tokyo in October 2017.
								The manga series has been licensed for an English language release in North America by Viz Media, while the anime series is licensed by Crunchyroll and Funimation.</p>
								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title">Plot</h2>
								<p class="mb-4">The series focuses on Asta, a young orphan who was raised from birth after being abandoned at the doorstep of an orphanage in Hage village along with his fellow orphan, Yuno. While everyone is born with the ability to utilize Mana in the form of Magical Power (魔力, Maryoku), Asta is the only exception. He tries to gain magical power through physical training. Conversely, Yuno was born as a prodigy with immense magical power and the talent to control wind magic. Motivated by a desire to become the next Wizard King, an authority figure second to the king of Clover Kingdom, the two youths developed a friendly rivalry. Yuno obtains a legendary four-leaf grimoire held by the kingdom's first Wizard King. Asta, despite his lack of magic, obtained the mysterious five-leaf grimoire (which cannot be clearly identified by others since it is worn out), which contains mysterious elf swords and rare anti-magic. Afterward, he and Yuno each join a Magic Knight squad as the first step to fulfill their ambitions. Throughout the story Asta and Yuno embark on various adventures, as they make a name for themselves throughout the Clover Kingdom. Both characters strive to one day hold the title of Wizard King.</p>
								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title">Anime</h2>	
								<p class="mb-4">In November 2019, Crunchyroll listed Black Clover in their "Top 100 best anime of the 2010s". In December 2020, Crunchyroll announced the aggregated Top 10 most popular anime works by country and region during the period from July to September of the same year, and it was revealed that Black Clover was the most watched anime, ranking in a total of 19 countries including the United States, Australia, Brazil and France.</p>
