								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken) </h2>
								<p class="mb-4"> Is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. It was originally serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine from 1987 to 2004, and was transferred to the monthly seinen magazine Ultra Jump in 2005. The series is divided into eight story arcs, each following a new protagonist bearing the "JoJo" nickname; the eighth part, JoJolion, began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is Shueisha's largest ongoing manga series by volume count, with its chapters collected in 129 tankōbon volumes as of December 2020.</p>
								<p class="mb-4">A 13-episode original video animation series adapting the manga's third part, Stardust Crusaders, was produced by A.P.P.P. and released from 1993 to 2002. The studio later produced an anime film adapting the first part, Phantom Blood, which was released in theaters in Japan in 2007. In October 2012, an anime television series produced by David Production adapting Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency began broadcast on Tokyo MX. As of July 2019, the studio has produced four seasons adapting through the manga's fifth part, Golden Wind. A live-action film based on the fourth part, Diamond Is Unbreakable, was released in Japan in 2017.</p>
								<p class="mb-4">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is well-known for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western popular music and fashion, and creative battles centered around Stands, psycho-spiritual manifestations with unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history, and it has spawned a media franchise including one-shot manga, light novels, and video games. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by Viz Media, which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.</p>
								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title">Plot</h2>
								<p class="mb-4">The universe of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a reflection of the real world with the added existence of supernatural forces and beings. In this setting, some people are capable of transforming their inner spiritual power into a Stand (スタンド, Sutando); another significant form of energy is Hamon (波紋, "Ripple"), a martial arts technique that allows its user to focus bodily energy into sunlight via controlled breathing. The narrative of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is split into parts with independent stories and different characters. Each of the series' protagonists is a member of the Joestar family, whose mainline descendants possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular "JoJo". The first six parts take place within a single continuity whose generational conflict stems from the rivalry between Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando, while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.</p>
								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title">Production</h2>	
								<p class="mb-4">For JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base before introducing modern elements. As an example, he often draws in a realistic style but uses surreal colors. Araki has been aiming to draw real spirits in JoJo resulting in him going to the Kappa River in Tōno, Iwate, to get a better understanding of the concept. Araki claims to be inspired from the art of the 1980s, shading techniques in Western art, and classical paintings; the manga coloring is based on calculations rather than consistency, with Araki citing artists like Paul Gauguin as inspiration. He also claims mystery is the central theme of the manga, as he was fascinated by it as a child. Furthermore, Araki wanted to explore superpowers and energy in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure resulting in various concepts such as the Hamon and the Stands.</p>
