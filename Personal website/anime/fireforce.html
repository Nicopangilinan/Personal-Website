								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title">Fire Force (En'en no Shōbōtai)</h2>
								<p class="mb-4"> is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Atsushi Ōkubo. It has been serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine since September 2015, and collected into 26 tankōbon volumes as of November 2020.</p>
								<p class="mb-4">An anime television series adaptation by David Production aired from July to December 2019 on the MBS's Super Animeism block. A second season aired from July to December 2020.

								In North America, the manga has been licensed for an English language release by Kodansha USA, and the anime television series has been licensed by Funimation.</p>
								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title">Setting</h2>
								<p class="mb-4">The Great Disaster (大災害, Daisaigai) is an event that happened two hundred and fifty years before Year 198, with the world mostly consumed in flame, many nations destroyed, and most of the planet rendered uninhabitable. The survivors took refuge in the Tokyo Empire, which remained mostly stable during the period despite losing some of its landmass. The Tokyo Emperor Raffles I establishes the faith of the Holy Sol Temple as it and Haijima Industries developed the perpetual thermal energy plant Amaterasu to power the country. In Year 198 of Tokyo's Solar Era, special fire brigades called the Fire Force fight increasing incidents of spontaneous human combustion where human beings are turned into living infernos called "Infernals" (焰ビト, Homura Bito). While the Infernals are first generation cases of spontaneous human combustion, with more powerful horned variations known as Demons, later generations possess pyrokinesis while retaining human form. The Fire Force was formed by combining people with these powers from the Holy Sol Temple, The Tokyo Armed Forces, and the Fire Defense Agency, and is composed of eight independent companies.</p>
								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title">Plot</h2>	
								<p class="mb-4">Shinra Kusakabe is a third generation pyrokinetic youth who gained the nickname "Devil's Footprints" for his ability to ignite his feet at will. He joins Special Fire Force Company 8, which features other pyrokinetics who dedicated themselves to ending the Infernal attacks for good while investigating Companies 1 through 7 for potential corruption in their ranks. Shinra begins to learn that his younger brother's abduction during the fire that killed their mother 12 years ago is caused by a mysterious doomsday cult that is behind the Infernal attacks. Company 8 and their allies oppose the White Cloaks and their Knights of the Ashen Flame, who seek certain individuals like Shinra and his brother (Sho) to enact a scheme to repeat the Great Disaster.</p>
